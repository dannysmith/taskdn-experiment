      notes: `## Overview

Health is the foundation everything else is built on. When I neglect this area, everything else suffers—my focus at work, my patience with people I care about, my ability to think clearly.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm prioritizing:
- **Sleep quality** over sleep quantity (aiming for consistent 7h rather than inconsistent 8h)
- **Movement throughout the day** rather than just gym sessions
- **Meal prep** to avoid decision fatigue and poor choices when tired

## Key Metrics

- Morning energy levels (subjective 1-10 scale)
- Weekly workout completion rate
- Sleep consistency (bedtime variance)`,

      notes: `## Philosophy

I'm not trying to get rich—I'm trying to build enough financial margin that money stops being a source of stress. That means:
1. Spending less than I earn (obvious but hard)
2. Having enough runway to handle surprises
3. Not checking my portfolio obsessively

## Current Situation

Emergency fund is at 4 months of expenses. Goal is 6 months by end of Q2. Investment contributions are automated, which removes the temptation to time the market.

## Annual Review

Tax prep starts in January. Need to be more organized this year—last year was a scramble.`,

      notes: `## Why This Matters

Coding isn't just my job—it's how I think through problems. The side projects keep my skills sharp and give me space to experiment with things I can't try at work.

## Current Interests

- **Rust**: Systems programming, finally understanding ownership
- **Local-first software**: CRDTs, sync engines, offline-capable apps
- **Developer tools**: Building things that make other developers' lives easier

## Learning Approach

I learn best by building. Tutorials are fine for syntax, but real understanding comes from hitting walls and figuring out how to get around them.`,

It's easy to let relationships slide when work gets busy. This area exists to make sure I don't.

## Recurring Commitments

- **Weekly family calls**: Sunday evenings, non-negotiable
- **Monthly friend catchups**: Rotating through the core group
- **Quarterly visits**: Try to see parents/siblings in person

## Things I Want to Be Better At

- Remembering birthdays without calendar reminders
- Being present during conversations (phone away)
- Initiating plans instead of always waiting for others`,

This covers the marketing and sales efforts for my indie products. Currently focused on growing the newsletter and preparing for the Q2 product launch.

## Strategy

1. **Content-first approach**: Build audience through genuinely useful content
2. **Email over social**: Own the relationship, don't rent it
3. **Customer conversations**: Talk to users constantly, not just when something's broken

## Key Numbers

- Newsletter subscribers: ~2,400
- Open rate: 42% (good but could be better)

## Priorities

- Regular quality time (not just existing in the same space)
- Trying new things together
- Maintaining individual identities while growing as a couple

## Notes

We've settled into comfortable patterns, which is nice but also means we need to be intentional about novelty and adventure.`,

Build a sustainable morning workout routine that I actually stick to. Not trying to become a bodybuilder—just want consistent movement to start the day.

- **Wake up**: 6:30 AM (non-negotiable)
- **Workout**: 6:45-7:30 AM (45 min including warmup/cooldown)
- **Rotation**: Push/Pull/Legs/Cardio/Rest

## What's Working

The home gym setup has been a game-changer. Removing the friction of going to a gym means I actually do it.

When I don't meal prep, I make bad food choices. It's that simple. Tired brain + no prepared food = ordering pizza.

## Current System

**Sunday afternoon (2-3 hours):**
1. Prep proteins (usually chicken + one other)
2. Roast vegetables (big sheet pan)
3. Cook grains (rice cooker does the work)
4. Portion into containers

## Recipes in Rotation

- Chicken shawarma bowls
- Beef and broccoli
- Turkey meatballs with roasted veg
- Salmon with quinoa (prep day-of, doesn't store well)

## Shopping

Costco run every 2 weeks. Trader Joe's for specialty items.`,

I was averaging 5.5 hours of broken sleep. That's not sustainable. This project is about fixing that.

## Changes Made

- **Environment**: Blackout curtains, cooler room (67°F), white noise
- **Behavior**: No screens after 10 PM (mostly successful), no caffeine after 2 PM
- **Timing**: Consistent bedtime even on weekends (this was the hardest)

## Results So Far

Average sleep is up to 7.1 hours. More importantly, I'm waking up before my alarm most days, which suggests better sleep quality.

## Next Steps

Want to experiment with sleep tracking to see if there are patterns I'm missing.`,

- Job loss
- Major medical expense
- Critical home/car repair

NOT for:
- Vacations

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Great tooling (cargo is a joy)
- Growing ecosystem for CLI tools and systems programming
- Tauri uses it (relevant for the task app project)

## Learning Path

1. ~~The Rust Book (chapters 1-10)~~ ✓
2. ~~Rustlings exercises~~ ✓
3. Build something real (in progress)
4. Contribute to an open source Rust project

## Current Project

Building a CLI tool for managing markdown task files. Practical application of what I'm learning.

## Struggles

- Borrow checker still trips me up
- Async Rust is confusing
- Lifetimes feel like dark magic`,

A task manager that:
- Stores everything as local markdown files
- Works offline-first
- Syncs via git (no proprietary cloud)
- Has keyboard-driven UI like Things 3

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Desktop**: Tauri (Rust backend)
- **Styling**: Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Data**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter

## Current Phase

UI exploration. Building out the interface before connecting to the Tauri backend.

## Design Principles

1. Fast above all else
2. Keyboard-navigable
3. Minimal chrome, maximum content
4. Works without internet`,

## Contributions This Year

- **shadcn/ui**: Documentation fixes, one component improvement

- **Various**: Small typo fixes (counts!)

## Projects I Want to Contribute To

- Helix editor (need to level up Rust first)
- Zed editor (same)
- Obsidian plugins (more realistic short-term)

## Approach

1. Start by using the project extensively
2. File good bug reports
3. Fix documentation issues (low barrier)

3. **Post-launch (June)**: Gather feedback, iterate

## Pricing Strategy

- Early bird: $99
- Regular: $149
- Bundle with future products: TBD

## Key Insights

1. **Pain point**: Existing tools are too complicated or too simple
2. **Desire**: People want to own their data
3. **Willingness to pay**: Higher than expected for the right solution
4. **Feature requests**: Keyboard shortcuts, quick capture, file-based storage

## How This Shapes the Roadmap

Validated the task app concept. People really want local-first + good UX. Most competitors sacrifice one for the other.
